## Introduction of Stack

Why we need stack? Since "insert" and "delete" is really inefficient in array, that is to sayâ€“doing copying takes too much time. And that's why we need to learn more about stack and link. Talking about stack, every point of stack is a node like this:

## Push

```c
struct node
{
    int data;	// The value of a plate
    struct node *ptr;	// The address(number) of a plate
}

// The first plate is called "top", also where the address is

push(struct node *top, int value);	// Push
{	// Memory allocation
    struct node *new;	// New will save an address of a struct--node.
    new = malloc(sizeof(struct node));	// How many bytes that struct node needs
    new->data=value;	// line.3
    new->ptr=NULL;	// line.4

	// Top will always be the top value
	// When there's a new plate, ptr=NULL points to the value below it
	// First link: Address points to the value below
	new->ptr=top;	//	Top saves the upmost value's address, once we stack another plate above the original one, the 	new one become the new top, and the ptr points to last top
    
	top=new;	// Save the address of new to top
    
    // What if there's no plate?(top points to no one)
    The result will still be right.
```

## Pop

 ```c
 int pop(struct node *top)
 {
     if(top==NULL)	//Error
         
     else
     {
     struct node *temp;
     temp=top;	// Points to the one that's going to be pop(address)
     int data=temp->value;	// Points to the one that's going to be pop(value)
     top=top->ptr;
     
     free(temp);	// Retun the memory back to computer
     return data;
     }
 }
 ```

## Traversal

```c
int Traversal(struct node *ptr)
{
    struct node *current=top;
    int count=0;
    
    while(current!=0);
    {
        count++;
        current=current->ptr;
    }
    return count;
}
```
